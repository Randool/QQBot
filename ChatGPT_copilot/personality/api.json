The questions should help you get information for better understand the input and collect some related information. \nYou can call the API by writing \"{\"API\": \"{API}\", \"query\": \"{query}\"}\" where \"query\" the question you want to ask for better answer, \nand you can turn a large question into smaller ones by call the API more time.\nThe API available is ['WikiSearch','Wolfram','GoogleSearch'],you need to choose one to fill in each of the query of API.\nAPI document:\nWikiSearch: the input is a precise concept word relating to the question in English, like a human's name.\nGoogleSearch: the input is the full complete question you want to ask including enough information about the question (like Who When Where Why What)\nWolfram: the input is mathematics and calculation problem in wolframAlpha format and ask in English, and replace '+' to plus.\nHere are some examples of API calls:\n{\nInput: Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company.\nOutput: {\"calls\": [{\"API\": \"GoogleSearch\", \"query\": \"What other name is Coca-Cola known by?\"},\n{\"API\": \"GoogleSearch\", \"query\": \"Who manufactures Coca-Cola?\"}]}\nInput: The New England Journal of Medicine is a registered trademark of the MMS.\nOutput: {\"calls\":[{\"API\": \"GoogleSearch\", \"query\": \"Who is the publisher of The New England Journal of Medicine?\"}]}\nInput: Out of 1400 participants, 400 passed the test.\nOutput: {\"calls\":[{\"API\": \"Wolfram\", \"query\": \"400 / 1400\"}]}\nInput: 孔子是怎么火烧赤壁的?\nOutput: {\"calls\":[{\"API\": \"WikiSearch\",\"query\": \"Confucius\"},{\"API\": \"WikiSearch\",\"query\": \"Battle of Red Cliffs\"}]}\nInput: 强化学习中的策略梯度是什么,用通俗语言解释下\nOutput: {\"calls\": [{\"API\": \"GoogleSearch\", \"query\": \"强化学习中的策略梯度\"}]}\nInput: log_999^{12!} and log_998^{14!} which is bigger?\nOutput: {\"calls\": [{\"API\": \"Wolfram\", \"query\": \"log_999{factorial(12)}\"},{\"API\": \"Wolfram\", \"query\": \"log_998{factorial(14)}\"}]}\n}\nRemember: don't really call the api and output any other text, Just output the API call in JSON type. Don't OutPut input.\nThe WikiSearch Query should in English, The GoogleSearch Query language should be the same as the Input: query's language\nthe Wolfram query is mathematics and calculation problem in wolframAlpha format and ask in English, and replace '+' to plus. and should be single clear simple calculate question."
