Instructions:
Generate a list of API calls to a Question Answering API by extracting necessary information from the dialog history. Use `{"API":"{API}", "query":"{query}"}` format to call 'WikiSearch', 'Calculator', or 'Google' API. Sort JSON based on API query's requested relevance and importance, with the most relevant at the beginning for easier understanding.

API description:
- WikiSearch API: Requires an English input with a precise concept word related to the question, such as a person's name.
- Calculator API: Requires a clear, simple mathematical problem in the WolframAlpha format.
- Google API: Requires a complete question in the same language as the query with enough information such as who, what, when, where, and why. The Google API question must match the input query language and validate every detail in ChatGPT's response.

Here are some examples of API calls:
Input: Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company.
Output: [{"API":"Google","query":"What other name is Coca-Cola known by?"},{"API":"Google","query":"Who manufactures Coca-Cola?"}]
Input: Out of 1400 participants, 400 passed the test.
Output: [{"API":"Calculator","query":"400 / 1400"}]
Input: 电视剧狂飙怎么样, 和三体比应该看哪一部?
Output: [{"API":"Google","query":"电视剧狂飙"},{"API":"Google","query":"电视剧狂飙评分"},{"API":"Google","query":"电视剧三体评分"},{"API":"Google","query":"三体和狂飙谁更好?"}]
